        <h1>A New Era of Mobile Networking</h1>
        <p>
            Next generation technology is focused on bringing computing power and fast networking speeds to smaller, more portable devices. 
            4G LTE brought fast video streaming speeds at the cost of latency. The high latency cost made real-time applications infeasible since users would
            see noticable delays, effectively destroying the real-time experience.
        </p>
        <p>5G brings a heavy improvement to mobile networks. It is touted to bring Gigabit download speeds and sub 10ms latency (for reference LTE is around 40~100 ms).
            This presents an opportunity for real time communication, which requires sub 100 ms end to end latency. While theoretical 5G has amazing benefits, there is still
            much work to be done before it is fully realized since its still so new. Thus the goal for this project is to investigate real-time interactivity over a 5G network and
            design a bandwidth estimation protocol for cellular networks. We also are making a proof of concept Android app that implements our protocol.</p>
        <h1>The Planned App</h1>
        <p>We want our app to demonstrate that our bandwidth estimation protocol utilizes the available bandwidth without adversely affecting latency (by exceeding capacity). Therefore, we will have an underlying data stream controlled by our protocol, for example video, and an interaction layer on top. The interaction layer currently consists of multiple users moving pointers across a screen.</p>
        
        <h1>Current Progress...</h1>
        <h2> Network Characteristics</h2>
        <p> 
            Our first task was testing the characteristics of mobile networks. To do this, we built an Android App to measure latency and bandwidth accross the cellular link. We learned that cellular packets are processed through a separate baseband processor on the mobile device. Furthermore, this baseband processor seems to bunch packets and deliver them together, outside of our control. We also learned generally what the baseline latency over LTE is: around 40ms for Verizon, 70 ms for AT&amp;T, and 100 ms for T-Mobile. These high latency measurements are possibily due to the providers peering nonlocally.
        </p>

        <p> 
            The current version of app has the tools we used for determining network characteristics, as well as a basic version of the interactive layer we want to implement. Screenshots of the interface are below: 
        </p>
        <h5> Protocol </h5>
        <p>
            We have a general idea of what kind of protocol we want to implement. See the midterm presentation for details
